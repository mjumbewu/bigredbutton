Big Red Button [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/openplans/bigredbutton.png)](http://travis-ci.org/openplans/bigredbutton)
==============================

This is a simple [Shareabouts](https://github.com/openplans/shareabouts) client
app designed to quickly collect public demand for, well, anything. It's named
after the infamous [Big Red Button](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_red_button).

It's built on the Shareabouts Django starter kit to easily integrate with the
[Shareabouts API](https://github.com/openplans/shareabouts-api).
